Repository for scripts to synthesise trait data related to fire sensitivity for mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian species in Victoria, Australia. 

### Versions

- Version 0.1: Initial commit for trait database compilation and initial species clustering based on SMP EE data. More to be done in terms of trait compilation and testing of alternative fire response measures (e.g. FAME). Also need to fix gaps in reptile and frog traits (e.g. diet, nesting, stratum) before results are sensible with trait importance scores, and also find better method for small sample size (e.g. frogs).
